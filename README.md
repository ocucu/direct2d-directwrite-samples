# Direct2D and DirectWrite Samples Collection
<p>This repository contains a collection of Visual Studio C++ demo projects using MFC framework and wrapper classes for <strong>Direct2D</strong> and <strong>DirectWrite</strong> library interfaces.</p>
<p>Download and extract zip archive or clone the repository, then open <strong>ALL SAMPLES.sln</strong> in Visual Studio. Altrnativelly you can open one of the solutions located in 'src' folder, e.g. <strong>Brush Samples.sln</strong>, <strong>Brush Transform Samples.sln</strong> and so on.</p>

## Solution contents
* Demo Framework library (Direct2D helpers and MFC-extensions to be used in all sample projects)
* Direct2D – Brush
* Direct2D – Brush Transform
* Direct2D – Render Target Transform
* DirectWrite – Text Format
* Direct2D - Photo Effects
* Direct2D - Filter Effects

## Additional notes
* You can find a short description for each demo project at [Codexpert Blog](https://codexpertro.wordpress.com/)
* So far, the solution's projects are configured for 10.0.17763.0 Windows SDK version and Visual Studio 2017 (v141) platform toolset. However it's not a problem if you want to reconfigure to a newer Windows SDK version and/or a newer platform toolset if you have a newer Visual Studio version.  
* This repository is not intended to be an architecture and design "masterpiece". However it respects as much as possible the document-view MFC architecture and the KISS paradigm.
